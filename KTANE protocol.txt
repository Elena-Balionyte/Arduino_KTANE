a message is a length, then a type, and then length-2 bytes of data
e.g. 0x04 0x00 0xff 0x00(len=4, type=0, data = 0xff00)
N bytes means variable,  bytes are - the 2 required ones
Messages from pi to arduino:
0 bytes Bomb exploded 0x00
0 bytes Bomb defused 0x01
0 bytes Start of setup phase 0x02
1 byte difficulty 0x03
0 bytes End of setup phase 0x04
2 bytes Time remaining 0x05
1 byte Serial number index 0x06
1 byte leds bitmask(the indicators CAR, FRK, NSA and others)  0x07
1 byte batteries(upper nibble = AA count, lower nibble = D count) 0x08
2 bytes ports(first byte first crumb = DVI-D count, first byte second crumb = Parallel port count, first byte third crumb = PS/2 count, first byte fourth crumb = RJ-45 count, second byte first crumb = Serial port count, second byte second crumb = Stereo RCA port count) 0x09
N bytes Setup data 0x0a
N bytes Relay data(first byte = id of target module) 0x0b

ID list
0 = suitcase
1 = timer
2 = souvenier
3 = morse
4 = button
255 = pi

morse module 
sends the array of the freqency and word to sovenier(first byte is length of the word, next is freq-3500, next ones are letters)

button module
sends the chosen word, then button color, lastly the strip color(all are 1 byte, following the mapping below)
byte to word: 0 = ABORT, 1 = DETONATE, 2 = HOLD, 3 = PRESS
byte to colors: 0 = RED, 1 = WHITE, 2 = BLUE, 3 = YELLOW, 4 = GREEN
